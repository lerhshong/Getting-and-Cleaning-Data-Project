Data of the project can be found here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The data records the activities of 30 individuals performing six activities. Measurements were recorded from the in-built accelerometer
and gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy II attached to the individuals' waist. Obtained measurements include:
  * Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer and the estimated body acceleration
  * Triaxial angular velocity from the gyroscope

The features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

# Objective of the project
  *To clean the data and merge the datasets provided (a training set and test set). 
  *Create a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
  
# Variable names
  * X/Y/Z - indicates the axis of vector
  * time/freq - a fourier transform was applied to the data - this indicates if the data is in time domain or frequency domain.
